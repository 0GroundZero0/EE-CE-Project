----------------------- PRESENT STATE SECTION (REGISTER) --------------------------------------------

--  The function of this section is to assign the next state to the present state at the active clock edge.
--  An asynchronous reset signal should be included to initialize the system to the default first state of the system. 
--  This section is implemented with sequential (behavioral) VHDL code with a PROCESS.
